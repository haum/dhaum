# dHAUM

The dHAUM is a geodetic structure which can be used as a base for several projects.

The geodetic dome itself is a 5/8eme of a sphere structure, assembled using :

- 95 pieces of wood of 2 different types
- 36 connectors of 4 different types
- 190 bolts, nuts and washers

## Use cases

The dHAUM have been used to :

- create a huge group-played musical instrument : the [dHAUMidi](https://github.com/haum/dhaumidi)

## Repository

- ``doc/`` : documentation (build report, model, blueprint, etc...)
- ``parts/`` : DXF and milling gcodes for parts of the dome itself
- ``tools/ : DXF and milling gcodes for tools used to machine the wooden parts

Computation are done using the software [Zome Dome & Cie](http://www.ardheia.fr/ardheia/index.php/ressources).

Inside the ``doc/`` folder, you'll find :

- ``dHaum.zdc`` project file for the software
- ``Geodome.pdf`` building report generated by ZDC
- ``developpe.pdf``& ``developpe.dxf`` global plane developpement
- ``patron_4imp.pdf`` file to print 5 times to build a mock-up of the dHAUM at a 1/12.5 scale.
    Gluing works this way : capital letters must be glued on another print, lowercase letters must be glued on the same print but no strips are drawn : create yours. You should start by A, then B, a, C, D and finally b.
